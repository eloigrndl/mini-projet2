# EPFL CS107 - Mini-Projet #2

Second mini-project of the first year @ EPFL (CS_107 course) : Grid Game

Antoine BELLANGER / Eloi GARANDEL

### Launch the game

To start the game, launch `Play` : the `Enigme` level will be started by default.

`Demo1` as well as `Demo2` can also be started using `Play` : to do so, comment/uncomment the right `Game` level in the Play file.  

### Controls

* _Enter_ : Pause
* _Arrows_ : Move
* _L_ : Interact with an Objet
* _K_ : Close a dialog

### Additional resources

* Background music : Eric Skiff - All Of Us - Resistor Anthems (Sous license CC 4.0 CC-BY). Available [here](https://ericskiff.com/music/).

### Side-notes

To turn off the music, set the `boolean isSoundSupported()` in `SwingWindow` to `false`.

If you are blocked by the torches and the `PressureSwitch` in the Enigme1 level, turn on/off the torches to reproduce the "pattern" of the switches to make the rock disappear.
